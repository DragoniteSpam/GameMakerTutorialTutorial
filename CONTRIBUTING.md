# Contributing to the Tutorial Tutorial

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/GameMakerTutorialTutorial/issues) or [make a pull request](https://github.com/DragoniteSpam/GameMakerTutorialTutorial/pulls). Try to keep contributions in the same style as the original text.

I'm probably only going to accept changes that make the actual tutorial itself better. Requests for jokes will not be accepted. This kind of thing is funny the first time you see it because of the unexpectedness factor, but I'm not going to run it into the ground.
