# GameMaker Tutorial Tutorial

GameMaker's currently running a [Helpful Dev Jam](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/helpful-devjam), which means that we're going to be seeing an influx of tutorial-related content in the next few days. This is doubtlessly going to be a lot of peoples' first exposure to both following and creating tutorials, so here are two helpful guides to guide you through the process!

## How To Create A Tutorial

There's a persistent attitude that "those who can't do, teach" in some circles of modern educational theory. I think this is absolute bollocks and anyone who says this was either dropped as a baby and/or has sour grapes over being told by one of their forebearers that teaching was not a valid career option, or, in most cases, both. There's a (probably misattributed) Albert Einstein quote that goes something like "if you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself," which I find infinitely more palatable.

\*cough\* No I'm not upset about the state of contemporary educational institutions. Whatever gave you that idea?

ANYWAY. Have you ever thought to yourself "there's this thing that I know how to do in GameMaker, I wonder if it would be nice if I could tell other people how to do it, too?" If you have, you should probably consult a doctor for a remedy to such ideas ASAP [lest you spend all your time making tutorials such that you never actually have time to make a game](https://github.com/orgs/DragoniteSpam-GameMaker-Tutorials/repositories) but if that isn't a bother to you ~~or if you actually don't want to make a game and are just looking for a convenient excuse to get out of doing so~~ then this is the tutorial for you!

### Choosing a Subject

### Choosing an Audience

### Structuring the Tutorial

### Presenting the Material

### Creating a Written Tutorial

Congratulations, you're about 80% finished!

Since you already have your outline, pretty much everything that's left involves putting what you've come up with into words. A solid command of the language you're writing in helps immensely. You don't have to write in English. In fact, if you don't speak English, there might be a surprisingly large market for tutorial content in your language that has yet to be filled.

It's usually a good idea to avoid sounding too formal. You can find descriptions for pretty much any algorithm on Wikipedia, but technical articles on Wikipedia have a way of sounding like they were written by someone who's been trapped in a theoretical physics lecture hall for the last 45 years and there's a reason most people search for tutorials elsewhere.

It's also usually a good idea to avoid sounding too conversational. Some people find writing that's too conversational to ruin the immersion and it may be hard to focus on if you include too many weird jokes and self-referentialâ€” dammit...

Sprinkling in images and code samples throughout your text is often recommended. This gives people a reference as to where they should be at given points in the code, and if something starts to go wrong it gives them a way to pin down where it might have happened.

### Creating a Video Tutorial

Congratulations, you're about 20% finished!

### Marketing Your Tutorial

Look, marketing is *haaaaaaaard* and anyone who says they know the key to search engine optimization (SEO; if it sounds like an annoying corporate buzzword, that's because it is, albeit a useful one) is lying not only to you but also themselves, and also probably their mom, their grandma, their spouse, their dog, and their next-door neighbor regarding when they're going to return their weed whacker because, let's be real, the Internet is mature enough now for us to generally understand that it's a chaotic system that's constantly changing, and even duplicating what one person did to get their content to appear on Google searches the world over beat-for-beat will probably lead to wildly different results.

With that being said, there are some guidelines which might be occasionally useful.

1. **Be specific in your title and metadata**

People need to know what your thing is about, and by "people" I mean both the individuals that fall in your target audience and the search engine that they might use to find it. Google allegedly can read at a fourth-grade level, or a fifth-grade level, or a sixth-grade level, depending on who you ask, when you ask it, and how smart the person you ask thinks your average fourth-, fifth- or sixth-grader is. This can be a bit of help if you're creating a written tutorial or a video with full captions, and there's a nonzero chance that Google is also capable of deriving some understanding of video by now and we just haven't caught on yet, but giving it a little nudge in the right direction never hurts. It's going to be really hard to make `gm2 game dev spaghetti tutorial 01` rank higher in a search than `How To Cook Spaghetti - GameMaker Tutorial`.

There are a few SEO-related tools out there that you might consider trying which can do things like recommend keywords and ways to structure your titles. I haven't found one that I actually like yet but I've been assured that there are some good ones out there somewhere.

2. **Avoid being misleading in your title and metadata**

If you have a video description or meta tags or other helpful fields to fill out, be direct and don't try to game the system. Summarize what you're trying to do in simple terms in a way that someone who reads your description will have a pretty good idea if it'll help them at a glance. By pretty much all accounts [keyword stuffing](https://web.archive.org/web/20220605041154/https://www.straightnorth.com/faq/seo/what-keyword-stuffing/) ruined meta tags for pretty much everyone by the early 2000s, and these days if you try to outsmart the algorithm by writing out the word "spaghetti" five hundred times at the bottom of a video description it'll just push you farther down in the rankings - not to mention the fact that anybody who actually reads the description is going to start asking questions.

By the same coin, don't write misleading or annoyingly clickbaity titles and descriptions. Audience retention is currently one of the bigger (if not the biggest) factors in whether or not YouTube will recommend a video to someone. Clickbait has a tendency of making people leave a page and never come back once they realize that they've been had. This benefits nobody.

There's been an ongoing debate for pretty much the entire history of printed media about whether it's a good idea to use CAPITALIZATION and *EMPHASIS* and MAKE BOLD CLAIMS in titles: `The BEST Game Maker RAYRACED SPAGHETTI Tutorial (2022) (HD) (Also Works for CAPELLINI)`, and whether that kind of thing constitutes "annoyingly clickbaity" or not.

[![I haven't checked to see if anyone beat my world record yet](img/clickbait.png?raw=true "Grice's Maxim of Relation")](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://xkcd.com/641/)

I'm not going to tell you *not* to do this, but I am going to tell you that if you that if you do this and the Internet drags you over the coals for it that I will think it is very funny.

3. **Tell people that you made a thing**

Good SEO can get you pretty far, but it's also probably a good idea to be a bit proactive in putting URLs to your thing in places where interested parties might be likely to find it.

The fact that these are guidelines and not solid rules is exemplified by the fact that, 90% of the time, this is exactly what I do, because I'm a lazy sod and about five minutes after I post a thing I'll probably have forgotten that I made it in the first place.

4. **Don't tell EVERYBODY that you made a thing**

[Nobody likes gratuitous self-promotion](https://web.archive.org/web/20220417151710/https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/wiki/subreddit_guidelines#wiki_.5B7.5D_promotional_content_and_advertisements). In an amusing twist of fate, while I was taking a break from writing this post I checked the reports on the GameMaker subreddit and found someone posting crossposting something they made onto every game dev-related subreddit in existence. Their thing wasn't even related to GameMaker. It is no longer found on the subreddit.

5. **If you cover a subject that already has a lot of traffic, add something of your own to make it stand out**

This isn't to say that you're never allowed to cover a topic that [someone else has already made a tutorial on](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gamemaker+text+box+tutorial), but breaking into saturated markets is hard and doing it as a newcomer to the tutorial space is even harder.

Imagine someone searches for "gamemaker spaghetti tutorial," and the search engine retrieves four results. One of them has a million views, one of them has 500,000 views, one of them has 350,000 views, and one of them is yours and it has ten views. Even if yours ranks just as high in the search as the other three, people in general might be less likely to click on an unknown entity that has yet to prove itself through trial by democracy.

## Disclaimers

Not all tutorial content is going to work for all people; the ways that people learn and absorb information is just too varied. If a tutorial maker tries to cover every possible base to account for every possible caveat and edge case, the tutorial would be [a meandering mess and, paradoxically, absolutely nobody would find it even remotely useful](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111223017/https://archive.org/stream/ulysses04300gut/ulyss12.txt).
