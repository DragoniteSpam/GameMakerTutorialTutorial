# GameMaker Tutorial Tutorial

GameMaker's currently running a [Helpful Dev Jam](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/helpful-devjam), which means that we're going to be seeing an influx of tutorial-related content in the next few days. This is doubtlessly going to be a lot of peoples' first exposure to both following and creating tutorials, so here are two helpful guides to guide you through the process!

## How To Follow A Tutorial

If you've been on the Internet for any length of time, you've no doubt seen someone make the claim "I followed \[insert popular tutorial here\] but it didn't work. If you have, you know [exactly where this is going](https://youtu.be/o_Zu5Lr3rmY). If not, welcome to the Internet, have a look around, anything that brain of yours can think of can be found.

Often times, even with the best-made tutorials, following them beat-for-beat without mentally engaging with the content won't work out. If you're not vigilant, it's easy to let mistakes slip in unnoticed that cause the whole process to break. Most tutorials are presented in a setting that's a bit like a practice arena for a self-driving car, in that they're created in a mostly-empty test setting with minimal distractions or opportunities for unexpected things to go wrong. In the real world, of course, your game is going to have a ton of other things going on in parallel, perhaps with [questionably-engineered systems that run lots of red lights and throw rocks at things they don't recognize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)). This metaphor got away from me.

### Do You Need a Tutorial?

Let's say you have a question. The question can be about anything at all, but let's say you need the answer and you need it now. Depending on your question, you might need a tutorial!

For this thought experiment, let's say you have some questions about making **spaghetti.** Let's go over some different kinds of questions, and whether or not seeking a tutorial would be likely to answer it.

 - **Can your question be answered in one word (or a few simple words)?**

If your question is simple, looking up a tutorial might be overkill, or might not even be able to answer your question in a relevant way. `Is spaghetti vegetarian?` or `What's the plural of "spaghetti?"` or `If you put spaghetti in a blender, would you be eating it or drinking it?` are all great questions to ask, but they all can be answered in only a few words. You would likely be better off simply looking up an encyclopedia entry on spaghetti instead of a tutorial, or just banging on your next-door neighbor's window and checking if they know.

 - **Is your question highly specific to your current situation?**

In order to be able to follow a tutorial you first need the tutorial to exist, and the more specialized your question is to the predicament you find yourself in, the greater the odds that nobody will have created material addressing it yet. Let's say you're tasked with cooking for a big family get-together and you want to make spaghetti, but your stove is broken, you're out of parmigiana cheese, and your four-year-old niece cracks up and flings spaghetti at the wall whenever she's allowed any on her plate. If you search that question in Google it's unlikely that you'll find a direct answer. In cases like these, as when trying to feed a four-year-old with an aversion to funny-looking foods, you should probably break your question up into multiple smaller pieces before proceeding.

 - Your sub-questions might include:
   - `Alternatives to boiling water over a stove`
   - `Parmigiana cheese substitutes`
   - `How to restrain and feed unruly four-year-olds`

For those who are curious, "spaghetti" *is* the plural. "Spaghetto" is the singular, which means "thin string" in Italian, but nobody in their right mind would ever eat just one noodle of *spaghetto.* If your stove is broken I might suggest heating the pot over a grill, or just ordering take-out.

### Following the Tutorial

### What to Take Away From The Tutorial

## How To Create A Tutorial

There's a persistent attitude that "those who can't do, teach" in some circles of modern educational theory. I think this is absolute bollocks and anyone who says this was either dropped as a baby and/or has sour grapes over being told by one of their forebearers that teaching was not a valid career option, or, in most cases, both. There's a (probably misattributed) Albert Einstein quote that goes something like "if you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself," which I find infinitely more palatable.

\*cough\* No I'm not upset about the state of contemporary educational institutions, which have been suffering for decades from not giving teachers the respect they deserve or the resources they need to help kids succeed. Whatever gave you that idea?

ANYWAY. Have you ever thought to yourself "there's this thing that I know how to do in GameMaker, I wonder if it would be nice if I could tell other people how to do it, too?" If you have, you should probably consult a doctor for a remedy to such ideas ASAP [lest you spend all your time making tutorials such that you never actually have time to make a game](https://github.com/orgs/DragoniteSpam-GameMaker-Tutorials/repositories) but if that isn't a bother to you ~~or if you actually don't want to make a game and are just looking for a convenient excuse to get out of doing so~~ then this is the tutorial for you!

### Choosing a Subject

It can be on anything you want it to be! But just like your 12th grade English teacher kept nagging you about when it came to the subject of your senior paper, it helps to be specific in what you want to target. Here are some ideas for consideration to help narrow down the scope of what you want to make.

Let's imagine that I want to make a tutorial regarding making spaghetti (in GameMaker, obviously). We can try:

 - A tutorial on something simple that's a good place for people who are just getting started with GameMaker to try out: `Cooking Your First Meal: Spaghetti in GameMaker`

 - A tutorial on something [immensely complicated that only the most dedicated of dweebs will be interested in undertaking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_hT--4HOvrf_VYo26LNl3zN5uwfuC3CC): `Cooking Spaghetti on The International Space Station`

 - A tutorial on [weird stuff that might be mildly interesting in an "I had no idea that was a thing" kind of way but won't be of much use to normal people](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_hT--4HOvrfuKZqNs9uWGN5aZub0KrQC): `Cooking Spaghetti, But We Boil The Water Over a GPU Playing Crysis on Ultra Settings Instead of Over a Stovetop`

 - A tutorial on [something that's not super difficult but you think everybody should be doing and you want to get the word out about it](https://youtu.be/OdFpxSbgiBg): `Improving Your Spaghetti By Serving With a Bit of Olive Oil`

 - A tutorial on [common error messages that people might Google when they want help solving](https://youtu.be/YxSh1sUh_lA): `Help, I forgot to open the fume hood when I was cooking spaghetti and now the smoke detector is going off!`

It's a really good idea to make sure you're well-acquainted with the subject at hand before making a tutorial on it. This is both to safeguard against creating a tutorial presenting incorrect information as fact, and so that you can answer follow-up questions that people might have for you.

On the other hand, the only reason I passed my 9th grade World History final is because one of my friends emailed me at 10:30 PM the night before asking me to explain the notes that I didn't take to them, so perhaps there's an argument to be made that trying to explain something to someone else is the best way to learn it for yourself.

### Choosing an Audience

When creating a tutorial, it helps to have a target audience in mind. Are you creating material for complete beginners? Intermediate users who want to learn more? Nerds who want to really push the limits of what they can do?

You might expect this to correlate strongly with the last section, "choosing a topic," but it won't necessarily be. Even "easy" subjects "how to round a number" can get [a lot more complicated than you might expect](https://youtu.be/TS2AdGIN74Y), and if you're careful you can boil complex topics down to the bare essentials to make them easy to understand for beginners.

Anyway, the tempting answer to the audience question might be "everyone," but in practice that doesn't really work very well. The target audience you have in mind will have a sizable influence on the way you present the material. If you delve into the molecular composition of pasta and how preparing it in different ways affects its consistency in a tutorial for beginners, most of them will end up having a hard time following. If you spend too much time explaining that pasta is a food source enjoyed by many people around the world and you can probably buy some in your local supermarket in a tutorial for super nerds, you run the risk of them getting bored and skipping ahead - or, worse, looking for someone else's tutorial.

### Structuring the Tutorial

### Presenting the Material

### Creating a Written Tutorial

Congratulations, you're about 80% finished!

Since you already have your outline, pretty much everything that's left involves putting what you've come up with into words. A solid command of the language you're writing in helps immensely. You don't have to write in English. In fact, if you don't speak English, there might be a surprisingly large market for tutorial content in your language that has yet to be filled.

It's usually a good idea to avoid sounding too formal. You can find descriptions for pretty much any algorithm on Wikipedia, but technical articles on Wikipedia have a way of sounding like they were written by someone who's been trapped in a theoretical physics lecture hall for the last 45 years and there's a reason most people search for tutorials elsewhere.

[![](img/wikipedia2.png?raw=true "Friggin' nerds.")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_that_are_too_technical)

*Friggin' nerds.*

It's also usually a good idea to avoid sounding too conversational. Some people find writing that's too conversational to ruin the immersion and it may be hard to focus on if you include too many weird jokes and self-referential— dammit...

Sprinkling in images and code samples throughout your text is often recommended. This gives people a reference as to where they should be at given points in the code, and if something starts to go wrong it gives them a way to pin down where it might have happened.

### Creating a Video Tutorial

Congratulations, you're about 20% finished!

The good news is that when you're making a video tutorial, you don't need to sprinkle in images and code samples throughout because, well, that's what your entire deliverable is to begin with. The bad news is that there are like a dozen other things you need to keep on top of.

I don't want to get too far into the technical aspects of video production because many people have already written entire books about that sort of thing \[citation needed], but you will need:

 - A screen capture tool; these days most people like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

Things you don't *technically* need but you'll find yourself in want of pretty quickly include:

 - A computer capable of recording your screen at a steady frame rate. It might be worth checking the [system requirements](https://obsproject.com/wiki/System-Requirements) page on whatever recording software you're using, although in the real world you'll want your specs to a bit higher than these
 - A microphone, and relevant accessories such as cables or a pop filter
 - Video editing software
 - Adequate hard drive space

You can ~~always~~ usually clean up a recording in post if something doesn't work out, but if you can get a clean recording the first time it'll save you a lot of headache in editing. I recommend making a test project and rehearsing how you're going to run through it once or twice before you hit the record button, and when I say "I recommend" I mean I forget to do this like 90% of the time because I have the memory of a grasshopper so instead I get to spend like five extra hours editing at 3 AM the day before a deadline.

Once the recording is rolling, whatever form that takes, talk through whatever it is you're doing in a step-by-step way. The general shape of a video tutorial will usually be the same as a written one. If you've made adequate preparations beforehand you should be fine, but if it helps you might also want to write down an outline of how you're going to present the material as you might with a written tutorial, in addition to the things I talked about in the last paragraph.

Most people would tell you to stay on topic and not waste the viewer's time going on unrelated and ridiculous tangents, but I'm genetically incapable of not goofing off so it would probably be a bit mean-spirited to force other people to do the same. Instead I'll say that if you're going to goof off, keep it somewhat brief and semi-related to the topic at hand. If you do this for long enough, you'll start to develop a sense of for how long you can goof off before your audience starts to get annoyed ~~which for most people is "instantly."~~

Having some level of understanding of how you're going to edit the video is nice, though if you've never worked with video before you might not want to worry about it too much. The nice thing about pre-recorded video is that if you don't like how something came out the first time, or if you trip over your words, you can just cut the video andd o it over again

The nice thing about pre-recordec video is that if you don't likeow it came out the first time

Te nice thing about pte \*gagging noises\*

This is why I often recommend drinking water before recording and keeping some on hand at all times to people.

The nice thing about pre-recorded video is that if you don't like how something came out the first time, or if you trip over your words, you can just cut the video and do it over again. It should go without saying is that having to do this as infrequently as possible is ideal, but it's not the end of the world if you do. Try not to make the cuts too obvious, such as by having different things on screen before and after the cut or cutting the audio mid-word, since this can sometimes be distracting and cause people to focus on the edit instead of on the content.

Once you're finished, re-watch the whole thing from beginning to end, ideally after the final video has been rendered out. [Sometimes mistakes slip in](https://youtu.be/0St9UKojd0I?t=4200), which most people would rather catch before the video goes live for the whole world to see.

Because we obviously haven't gotten meta enough yet today, [I made a video tutorial on this for a channel anniversary a while ago that you might like](https://youtu.be/uGjEKZGwp9Y).

### Marketing Your Tutorial

Look, marketing is *haaaaaaaard* and anyone who says they know the key to search engine optimization (SEO; if it sounds like an annoying corporate buzzword, that's because it is, albeit a useful one) is lying not only to you but also themselves. The Internet is a chaotic system that's constantly changing, and even duplicating what one person did to get their content to appear on Google searches the world over beat-for-beat will probably lead to wildly and/or disastrously and/or hilariously different results.

With that being said, there are some guidelines which might be occasionally useful.

1. **Be specific in your title and metadata**

People need to know what your thing is about, and by "people" I mean both the individuals that fall in your target audience and the search engine that they might use to find it. Google allegedly can read at a fourth-grade level, or a fifth-grade level, or a sixth-grade level, depending on who you ask, when you ask it, and how smart the person you ask thinks your average fourth-, fifth- or sixth-grader is. This can be a bit of help if you're creating a written tutorial or a video with full captions, and there's a nonzero chance that Google is also capable of deriving some understanding of video by now and we just haven't caught on yet, but giving it a little nudge in the right direction never hurts. It's going to be really hard to make `gm tut 01` rank higher in a search than `How To Cook Spaghetti - GameMaker Tutorial`.

There are a few SEO-related tools out there that you might consider trying which can do things like recommend keywords and ways to structure your titles. I haven't found one that I actually like yet but I've been assured that there are some good ones out there somewhere.

2. **Avoid being misleading in your title and metadata**

Don't try to game the system. Summarize what you're trying to do in simple terms in a way that someone who reads your description will have a pretty good idea if it'll help them at a glance. By all accounts [keyword stuffing](https://web.archive.org/web/20220605041154/https://www.straightnorth.com/faq/seo/what-keyword-stuffing/) ruined meta tags for pretty much everyone by the early 2000s, and these days if you try to outsmart the algorithm by writing out the word "spaghetti" five hundred times at the bottom of a video description it'll just push you farther down in the rankings - not to mention the fact that anybody who actually reads the description is going to start asking questions.

By the same coin, don't write misleading or annoyingly clickbaity titles and descriptions. Audience retention is currently one of the bigger (if not the biggest) factors in whether or not YouTube will recommend a video to someone. Clickbait has a tendency of making people leave a page and never come back once they realize that they've been had. This benefits nobody.

There's been an ongoing debate for pretty much the entire history of printed media about whether it's a good idea to use CAPITALIZATION and *EMPHASIS* and MAKE BOLD CLAIMS in titles: `The BEST Game Maker RAYRACED SPAGHETTI Tutorial (2022) (HD) (Also Works for CAPELLINI)`, and whether that kind of thing constitutes "annoyingly clickbaity" or not.

[![I haven't checked to see if anyone beat my world record yet](img/clickbait.png?raw=true "Grice's Maxim of Relation")](https://web.archive.org/web/20220318231925/https://xkcd.com/641/)

*I haven't checked to see if anyone beat my world record yet.*

I'm not going to tell you *not* to do this, but I am going to tell you that if you that if you do this and the Internet drags you over the coals for it that I will think it is very funny.

3. **Tell people that you made a thing**

Good SEO can get you pretty far, but it's also probably a good idea to be a bit proactive in putting URLs to your thing in places where interested parties might be likely to find it.

The fact that these are guidelines and not solid rules is exemplified by the fact that, 90% of the time, this is exactly what I do, because I'm a lazy sod and about five minutes after I post a thing I'll probably have forgotten that I made it in the first place.

4. **Don't tell EVERYBODY that you made a thing**

[Nobody likes gratuitous self-promotion](https://web.archive.org/web/20220417151710/https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/wiki/subreddit_guidelines#wiki_.5B7.5D_promotional_content_and_advertisements). In an amusing twist of fate, while I was taking a break from writing this post I checked the reports on the GameMaker subreddit and found someone posting crossposting something they made onto every game dev-related subreddit in existence. Their thing wasn't even related to GameMaker. It is no longer found on the subreddit.

5. **If you cover a subject that already has a lot of traffic, add something of your own to make it stand out**

This isn't to say that you're never allowed to cover a topic that [someone else has already made a tutorial on](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gamemaker+text+box+tutorial), but breaking into saturated markets is hard and doing it as a newcomer to the tutorial space is even harder.

Imagine someone searches for "gamemaker spaghetti tutorial," and the search engine retrieves four results. One of them is Shaun's and has a million views, one of them is Cosmo's and has 500,000 views, one of them is Mathy's and has 350,000 views, and one of them is yours and it has ten views. Even if yours ranks just as high in the search as the other three, people in general might be less likely to click on an unknown entity that has yet to prove itself through trial by democracy.

Let's try going for an angle that nobody else has done yet.

`How To Cook Spaghetti with Pesto - GameMaker Tutorial`

Has anybody done GameMaker with pesto yet? Probably not. There we go.

As per guideline #2, don't do this unless your tutorial is actually about GameMaker and pesto, or you'll find yourself with a brand-new set of problems that you could have just avoided.

### Closing Thoughts

 - I like having sample code for people to download so that if something doesn't work they have something to compare their code against. Unfortunately, this can be a double-edged sword, since people can and will try to download and use your code without bothering to understand it, which can cause all manner of exotic problems downstream. Other creators choose not to provide a sample project, and [I know of at least one person provides sample code but keeps it behind a paywall](https://shaunjs.itch.io/shauns-complete-platformer-tutorial-series), which you might find to be an acceptable compromise.

 - [Goedel's incompleteness theorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) tells us that there are true statements that can never be proved by our current system of mathematics. This implies that there are questions that science will never be able to answer, and one of those questions is why so many people on YouTube think "I don't like your voice" is a useful thing to say in a comment. Ban them and move on.

 - Not all tutorial content is going to work for all people; the ways that people learn and absorb information is just too varied. If a tutorial maker tries to cover every possible base to account for every possible caveat and edge case, the tutorial would be [a meandering mess and, paradoxically, absolutely nobody would find it even remotely useful](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111223017/https://archive.org/stream/ulysses04300gut/ulyss12.txt).

Now you know how to make a GameMaker tutorial! Please don't make me regret writing this.
