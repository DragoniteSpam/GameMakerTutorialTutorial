# GameMaker Tutorial Tutorial

GameMaker's currently running a [Helpful Dev Jam](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/helpful-devjam), which means that we're going to be seeing an influx of tutorial-related content in the next few days. This is doubtlessly going to be a lot of peoples' first exposure to both following and creating tutorials, so here are two helpful guides to guide you through the process!

## Disclaimers

Not all tutorial content is going to work for all people; the ways that people learn and absorb information is just too varied. If a tutorial maker tries to cover every possible base to account for every possible caveat and edge case, the tutorial would be [a meandering mess and, paradoxically, absolutely nobody would find it even remotely useful](https://archive.org/stream/ulysses04300gut/ulyss12.txt).

I've spent a lot of time in the last few years making GameMaker tutorials, mostly on subjects that [normal people don't care about](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_hT--4HOvrcML9uqHe4fwBVTm650Vy3V).
