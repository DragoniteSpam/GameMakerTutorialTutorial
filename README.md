# GameMaker Tutorial Tutorial

GameMaker's currently running a [Helpful Dev Jam](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/helpful-devjam), which means that we're going to be seeing an influx of tutorial-related content in the next few days. This is doubtlessly going to be a lot of peoples' first exposure to both following and creating tutorials, so here are two helpful guides to guide you through the process!

## How To Create A Tutorial

There's a persistent attitude that "those who can't do, teach" in some circles of modern educational theory. I think this is absolute bollocks and anyone who says this was either dropped as a baby and/or has sour grapes over being told by one of their forebearers that teaching was not a valid career option, or, in most cases, both. There's a (probably misattributed) Albert Einstein quote that goes something like "if you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself," which I find infinitely more palatable.

\*cough\* No I'm not upset about the state of contemporary educational institutions. Whatever gave you that idea?

ANYWAY. Have you ever thought to yourself "there's this thing that I know how to do in GameMaker, I wonder if it would be nice if I could tell other people how to do it, too?" If you have, you should probably consult a doctor for a remedy to such ideas ASAP [lest you spend all your time making tutorials such that you never actually have time to make a game](https://github.com/orgs/DragoniteSpam-GameMaker-Tutorials/repositories) but if that isn't a bother to you ~~or if you actually don't want to make a game and are just looking for a convenient excuse to get out of doing so~~ then this is the tutorial for you!

## Disclaimers

Not all tutorial content is going to work for all people; the ways that people learn and absorb information is just too varied. If a tutorial maker tries to cover every possible base to account for every possible caveat and edge case, the tutorial would be [a meandering mess and, paradoxically, absolutely nobody would find it even remotely useful](https://archive.org/stream/ulysses04300gut/ulyss12.txt).

I've spent a lot of time in the last few years making GameMaker tutorials, mostly on subjects that [normal people don't care about](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_hT--4HOvrcML9uqHe4fwBVTm650Vy3V).
